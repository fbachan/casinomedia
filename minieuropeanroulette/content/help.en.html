<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
    The roulette wheel is marked with numbers 1 through 36, with an additional
    "0". The numbers are alternately coloured red and black, and the "0" is
    green.
</p>
<p>
    The roulette layout is divided into different sections - individual
    numbers and group bets. Bets made on individual or adjacent numbers or
    small groups of numbers are referred to as 'inside bets' while the bets
    covering groups of 12 or 18 numbers (e.g. red, odd, etc.) are known as
    'outside bets'.
